# C482
C482 Software 1
My project for C482. I could have dumped more time into polishing and optimizing this, but I didn't.
Now that it is done, I could remove all the code I commented out on the MainScreenController for alternative methods of opening windows.
I should create an alert function for future projects that I can call like this: alertFunction(alertType, titleText, headerText, contentText, resultBool).
Also, my prices were high enough that standard double formatting was an issue, sometimes they were displayed in exponential notation.
